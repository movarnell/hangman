# hangman
This is a simple javascript based hangman game I built while on a snow day. My son loves to play hangman with google docs and my clacky keyboard. This way we can play with something fun I made. 

To run this you will need to download and place them in a folder. Then double click the index.html file and it will launch the game in the browser.
